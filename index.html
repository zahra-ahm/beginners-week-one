<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/"> Code First Girls.</a> Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
  <li>Not having to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website! </li>
  <li>It's fun!</li>
</ol>
<h3>What do you need to create a website?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>
